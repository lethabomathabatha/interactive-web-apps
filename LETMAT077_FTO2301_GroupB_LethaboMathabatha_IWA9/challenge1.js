/* In this challenge, we are going to revisit and modify a previous challenge using object literals.

In the following snippet, we can update the IWA_6.4: Challenge 2 where we calculated the balance. 
However, it contains the same syntax errors as the challenge presented in the previous module - IWA_0.2: Challenge 1. 
This means that you will need to fix the syntax issues first.

 

Once again, you will need to ensure that the following behaviour works:
* The taxable amount should be subtracted from the salary before expenses are calculated
* The total should be the result of the after-tax amount with all expenses subtracted
 

However, there are some differences from the first time you encountered this functionality:
* All expenses are grouped in the expenses object.
* Instead of having a hardcoded tax amount, there is a tax object that has several reference 
  codes we can use to get different tax amounts. The one that we will use is 913
* Rent is listed using keys that are created from a combination of loading types and sizes.
* The matching key for rent should be created by interpolating the size and lodging variables provided.
* The number provided by this key should be used as the rent amount.
* You donâ€™t have to worry about having space separators between numbers in this version, 
  you can just log it as a single number value.
 
The final value that should be logged to the console should be: 2685.2
